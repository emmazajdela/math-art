This repository contains code to generate beautiful mathematically-related images. 

Feel free to use the code as you please. I would love to see what is done with it, so don't hesitate to tag me on Twitter @EmmaZajdela or email me: emmazajdela (at) u dot northwestern dot edu. 

The first code uploaded on July 6, 2022 came from my initial attempt at creating a Sankey plot in Python, which failed but turned into a cool design! It reminds me of multiple rolls of camera film intertwined. I've titled it "Janky Sankey." See the artist statement for full details about the piece.

More math art code will be forthcoming.
