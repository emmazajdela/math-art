This repository contains code to generate beautiful mathematically-related images. 

Feel free to use the code as you please. I would love to see what is done with it, so don't hesitate to tag me on Twitter @EmmaZajdela or email me: emmazajdela (at) u dot northwestern dot edu. 

The first code uploaded on July 6, 2022 came from my initial attempt at creating a Sankey plot in Python, which failed but turned into a cool design! It reminds me of multiple rolls of camera film intertwined. I've titled it "Janky Sankey." 

More math art code will be forthcoming.
