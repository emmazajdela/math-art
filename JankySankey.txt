“Janky Sankey” represents the feeling of experiencing change, most of which is in reality only a delusion. Traditionally, a Sankey plot illustrates the unidirectional flow of concepts from points A to B, but in “Janky Sankey,” most of the flow is cyclical, returning to its points of origin. In a similar way, the majority of our lived experiences as a society appear at first glance to be new, but ultimately return to its origin points. The imagery of “Janky Sanky” is reminiscent of camera film intertwined, with the multiple layers alluding to different levels stored in our collective memories. The thinnest layers flowing forwards in “Janky Sankey” offer a glimmer of hope; that change is indeed possible.
